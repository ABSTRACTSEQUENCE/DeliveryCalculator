A prototype of a calculator with support for custom properties and user-defined formulas.  
Users can either use it as a regular calculator by entering values manually, or define reusable formulas and properties, which are saved in the browser's local storage.

The system allows nesting: saved formulas can reference other properties or even other formulas, enabling creation of complex, layered calculations.

Features implemented:
âœ… Basic UI
âœ… Core calculation logic

Features in development:
ðŸ”§ Saving custom formulas and properties
ðŸ”§ Using formulas as variables inside other formulas

> This is a work-in-progress project built to practice dynamic UI manipulation and logic-heavy frontend architecture using vanilla JavaScript.
