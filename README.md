A prototype of a calculator with support for custom properties and user-defined formulas.  
Users can either use it as a regular calculator by entering values manually, or define reusable formulas and properties, which are saved in the browser's local storage.

The system allows nesting: saved formulas can reference other properties or even other formulas, enabling creation of complex, layered calculations.

<h2>Features implemented:</h2>
âœ… Basic UI <br>
âœ… Core calculation logic<br>

<h2>Features in development:</h2>
ðŸ”§ Saving custom formulas and properties<br>
ðŸ”§ Using formulas as variables inside other formulas<br>

> This is a work-in-progress project built to practice dynamic UI manipulation and logic-heavy frontend architecture using vanilla JavaScript.
